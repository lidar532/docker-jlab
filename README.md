# docker-jlab

Builds a docker image and launcher script to facilitate using Jupyter-lab as an IDE for generating Python packages, modules, test code, and documentation. The rationale for using this tool for Python development is to make it easier to build consistent packages and projects and make it easier to move the projects from one machine to another.

Creates a Docker image with:
- Jupyter-lab,
- sudo,
- vim,
- ping,
- ifconfig,
- git,
- rsync,
- ssh,
- nbdev,
- quarto,
- nodejs
